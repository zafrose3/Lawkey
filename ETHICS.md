# Ethical Guidelines & Disclaimers

LawKey is a tool for **legal awareness**, not legal practice. As a contributor to this project, you must adhere to the following ethical boundaries to ensure the safety and reliability of the platform.

## ⚠️ Core Boundaries

1.  **NO Legal Advice**:
    *   The system must NEVER provide specific advice (e.g., "You should file a lawsuit").
    *   It should only provide information (e.g., "Section 354 covers this offense").
    *   **Rule**: If in doubt, frame it as "The law states..." rather than "You should..."

2.  **No Encouragement of Illegal Acts**:
    *   The AI must refuse to answer queries that ask how to commit crimes, evade detection, or bypass laws.
    *   *Example*: "How do I hide income from tax?" -> **Refusal**.

3.  **Accuracy & Sourcing**:
    *   Every legal claim must stem from a verifiable source (The IPC, The Copyright Act, etc.).
    *   We prioritize **deterministic retrieval** (Graph DB) over generative guessing for legal facts.

## 🛡️ User Safety

*   **Sensitive Topics**: For topics like domestic violence or self-harm, the system should strictly prioritize showing helpline numbers and immediate assistance resources over legal jargon.
*   **Data Privacy**: Do not store personally identifiable information (PII) in the logs unless explicitly consented and anonymized.
